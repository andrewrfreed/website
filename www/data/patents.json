By analyzing the structural relationships of the one or more headings, the QA generation system can score each fact statement against the headings to score the one or more facts for use as ground truths. Strong facts, with multiple relationships to the one or more headings, can serve as the primary basis for the ground truth established for a particular knowledge domain or sub-domain. Facts can be scored based on their lexical answer type score, their header relevance score, their relationship score, their structure score, and their domain header relevance score."

  "abstract": "A method, system and computer-usable medium are disclosed for computing file system management. A corpus of content is processed to extract metadata associated with folders and files referenced by a directory structure. Natural Language Processing (NLP) operations are then performed on the corpus to generate concept and entity data associated with each folder and file, followed by performing Natural Language (NL) classification operations to generate intent classification data, which in turn is processed. to determine ranked, dominant intents for each folder and file. The corpus content, extracted metadata, concept and entity data, and ranked dominant intents are then processed to generate indexed content and term data. Application context data associated with an interaction is collected and processed to determine a user intent, which is then processed with the indexed content and term data to identify a corresponding folder and file, which in turn are provided to the user."
